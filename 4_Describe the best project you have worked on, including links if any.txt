I have worked on 4 to 5 Group projects , 2 single projects and "Friday"project is the best and some funniest project of all.
Its purely based on python language.
It is a chatbot system in which it takes me inspiration to create this project by watching Iron Man movie.
In the movie Tony Stark used to talk to a AI program and it will also help him in dire sitution.
The program in which I created is very interactive AI program, My bot will be able to do some tasks also.
its the base to the future in which all of them will be programmed by using AI.
